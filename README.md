# 3D Models for Puppet Skeletons

The 3D model files provided will allow you to assemble some basic skeletons for puppets in order to get started. 

The bolt hole sizes used throughout the models are 4.46mm in diameter, approximately the same as the servo motors provided in the kit. Therefore you will need the same size screw throughout the assembly of the model. 

You can mix and match parts to build different skeletons. Photos are provided for assembling the Alpaca and Crocodile skeletons.

Below is a description of the different parts. 

### head-frame
There are two sizes. Puppets with Alpaca-like shorter mouths should use “head-frame-short-mouth.stl” where as puppets with Crocodile-like long mouths should use “head-frame-long-mouth.stl”.

### head-extender
You can fill in space inside the puppet head by adding a “head extender”. Two sizes of 20mm and 40mm are provided. 

### moving-mouth
3 lengths of attachments are provided for the micro-servo to be used for the puppet’s mouths ranging from 50mm, 75mm and 100mm.

### top-mouth
3 lengths of attachments are provided for the stationary top mouth piece ranging from 50mm, 75mm and 100mm.

### pan-tilt-frame
Two frames are provided which would allow the puppet to pan and tilt. 

### stand
The stand provided has two components. This is to elevate your puppet to a reasonable height. We also provide two versions of the "stand-bottom" component, one is the full body and the other is split into two so you can print it easily if the full body does not fit. 

## Printing 

Units: Millimeters (mm)

The .stl files were saved as medium fidelity. Just to give you a reference with regards to size, most components have a 2mm thickness.
